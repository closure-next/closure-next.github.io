                <h2>Closure Next - Brand Guidelines</h2>
                  <h3>Last Update: 03/25/2025</h3>
			<p>Closure Next is a unique and valuable brand, and as such, its use should be carefully controlled to ensure that its identity is respected and not associated with activities or projects that are not aligned with the vision and mission of Neurenix. Below are the guidelines and rules for using the brand, including the name, logo, image, and any other visual or symbolic representation of Closure Next.</p>
		    <h3>1. Use of the Name "Closure Next":</h3>
		    	<p>Any use of the name "Closure Next" must comply with the following guidelines:</p>
		    	<p>- Authorization: The name "Closure Next" may be used as long as it aligns with the brand's vision and mission. The name should not be associated with activities that suggest endorsement, sponsorship, partnership, affiliation, or support for other projects or brands.</p>
		    	<p>- Transparency: Whenever using the brand name, ensure that there is no ambiguity that could suggest a relationship that does not exist, such as unauthorized partnerships.</p>
		    	<p>- Avoid Unauthorized Endorsements and Partnerships: The name "Closure Next" must not suggest endorsement, sponsorship, partnership, affiliation, or support for external projects, organizations, or initiatives without explicit authorization.</p>
		    <h3>2. Use of the Image and Logo:</h3>
		    	<p>The image and logo of Closure Next are key elements of the brand’s visual identity. The use of the logo is restricted and should be handled with care to maintain the integrity of the brand.</p>
		    	<p>- Do Not Modify the Logo: Closure Next logo must not be altered in any way. This includes changes to colors, shapes, adding elements, or any form of manipulation.</p>
		    	<p>- Respect Visual Integrity: When using the logo or brand image, ensure that the visual integrity of Closure Next is preserved. The logo should not be distorted, overlaid, or adjusted in any manner that would damage the brand’s perception.</p>
		    <h3>3. Associations with Third Parties:</h3>
		    	<p>Closure Next should only be associated with projects, products, or organizations that share its values and mission. Any use of the name or logo of Closure Next alongside other brands or initiatives must be done in a manner that does not imply endorsement or support without proper authorization.</p>
		    	<p>- Use of Name and Logo with Other Brands: When associating Closure Next with other brands or initiatives, the name and logo must be used in a way that does not imply that Closure Next is formally involved without explicit permission from the brand.</p>
		    <h3>4. Licensing and Compliance with Apache 2.0 License:</h3>
		    	<p>The Closure Next source code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, and these brand guidelines complement that license but do not override the permissions granted by the source code license.</p>
		    	<p>- Apache 2.0 License: The use of Closure Next source code under the Apache 2.0 license allows for the usage, modification, and distribution of the code, provided that the terms of the license are followed.</p>
		    	<p>- Brand Restrictions: However, the use of the name and logo of Closure Next is not covered by the Apache 2.0 license. The Apache 2.0 license allows for the use of the code, but it does not grant permission for using the name or logo of the brand outside of the conditions outlined in these brand guidelines.</p>
		    <h3>5. Changes to the Brand Guidelines:</h3>
		    	<p>These brand guidelines may be altered at any time. Any changes will be published in the official Closure Next repository and will be subject to the same transparency and approval process. All brand users must regularly check the guidelines to ensure compliance.</p>
		    	<p>Conclusion: Collaboration and respect for the brand guidelines will ensure the sustainable growth of Closure Next as a brand and project.</p>
		    	<h4>Note: The use of the name, logo, and image of Closure Next is subject to these Brand Guidelines in conjunction with the Apache 2.0 license for the Closure Next source code. Compliance with these guidelines ensures that the integrity of the brand is maintained in all instances of use.</h4>
