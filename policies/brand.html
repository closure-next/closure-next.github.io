                <h2>Closure Next - Brand Guidelines</h2>
                  <h3>Last Update: 02/21/2025</h3>
                    <p>Closure Next is a unique and valuable brand, and as such, its usage must be carefully controlled to ensure that its identity is respected and not associated with any activities or projects that are not aligned with the vision and mission of Closure Next. Below are the guidelines and rules for using the brand, including the name, logo, image, and any other visual or symbolic representation of Closure Next.</p>
                    <h3>1. Use of the Name "Closure Next":</h3>
                      <p>The name "Closure Next" is protected, and its usage is subject to explicit permission. Anyone or any organization wishing to use the name "Closure Next" in any context outside the use of the source code, such as in blogs, presentations, advertisements, promotions, or other external projects, must follow the procedure outlined below:</p>
                      <p>- Formal Request: To use the name "Closure Next" on any external platform, a formal request must be submitted via a pull request on the official Closure Next repository on GitHub:</p> 
                      <p><a href="https://github.com/MilesONerd/closure-next">https://github.com/MilesONerd/closure-next</a></p>
                      <p>- Approval or Denial: After submitting the pull request, Enzo Fuke, the person responsible for Closure Next, will review the request and decide whether to approve or deny the usage of the name. The decision will be public and recorded in the repository.</p>
                      <p>- Transparency: The request for usage of the name will be visible to all involved, ensuring transparency and avoiding misunderstandings. If a request is approved, usage will be allowed only under the terms approved. Otherwise, the individual or organization must immediately cease using the name.</p>
                      <p>Exceptions: Permission is not required to use the "Closure Next" in the code of the software or to directly contribute to the code of Closure Next, provided that the contribution complies with the Apache 2.0 license and does not involve the improper use of the name or the brand image.</p>
                    <h3>2. Use of the Image and Logo:</h3>
                      <p>The image and logo of Closure Next are fundamental elements of the brand's visual identity. As such, their use is restricted and must be handled with care. The logo may be used only in the following contexts:</p>
                      <p>- Permission for Use: Any use of the image or logo of Closure Next in promotional materials, websites, videos, or other external media must also be requested via a pull request in the Closure Next repository, as described in Item 1.</p>
                      <p>- Modifications to the Logo: The logo of Closure Next may not be altered or modified in any way without prior approval. This includes changes in colors, shapes, the addition of elements, or any form of manipulation.</p>
                      <p>- Respect for Visual Integrity: Any application of the logo or image must maintain the visual integrity of the brand. It is not allowed to distort, overlay, or make adjustments that could harm the perception of the brand.</p>
                    <h3>3. Association with Third Parties:</h3>
                      <p>Closure Next should only be associated with projects, products, or organizations that share its values and mission. Therefore, any request to use the name "Closure Next" or its images in partnership with other brands or initiatives must go through the approval process detailed in Item 1.</p>
                      <p>- Images and Content: When associating Closure Next with other brands or initiatives, the brand must be used in a way that does not imply endorsement, support, or partnership without explicit review and authorization. The use of the name and logo must always be clear and distinct, without suggesting that Closure Next is officially involved in other actions without the necessary authorization.</p>
                    <h3>4. Licensing and Compliance with Apache 2.0 License:</h3>
                      <p>The source code of Closure Next is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Therefore, the brand usage guidelines complement the license but do not replace the permissions provided by the source code license.</p>
                      <p>- Apache 2.0 License: The use of Closure Next's source code under the Apache 2.0 license allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the code as long as the terms of the license are met.</p>
                      <p>- Brand Restrictions: However, the use of the name and logo of Closure Next is not covered by the Apache 2.0 license. The Apache 2.0 license permits the use of the code but does not grant permissions for the use of the name or logo of Closure Next outside the conditions described in these Brand Guidelines.</p>
                    <h3>5. All Rights Reserved:</h3>
                      <p>All rights to the Closure Next brand, including its name, logo, and visual identity, are reserved by Enzo Fuke. Any unauthorized use of the name or logo of Closure Next may be subject to legal action according to applicable intellectual property laws.</p>
                    <h3>6. Penalties for Unauthorized Use:</h3>
                      <p>If any individual or organization uses the name or image of Closure Next without proper authorization, Closure Next reserves the right to demand the immediate removal of the unauthorized use and may take necessary legal measures to protect its brand. This includes, but is not limited to, actions to remove content from external platforms or litigation.</p>
                    <h3>7. Changes to Brand Guidelines:</h3>
                      <p>These Brand Guidelines may be changed at any time. Any modifications will be published in the official Closure Next repository and will be subject to the same transparency and approval rules via pull request. All users of the brand should regularly consult the guidelines to ensure compliance.</p>
                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                      <p>The use of the Closure Next brand is a privilege that must be treated responsibly. The pull request process for using the name and image of the brand is designed to ensure that the identity of Closure Next is preserved, and that its name is not associated with projects or initiatives that do not share its values. Collaboration and respect for the brand guidelines will ensure the sustainable growth of Closure Next as a brand and project.</p>
                      <h4>Note: The use of the name, logo, and image of Closure Next is subject to these Brand Guidelines in conjunction with the Apache 2.0 license for the Closure Next source code. Compliance with these guidelines ensures that the integrity of the brand is maintained in all instances of use.</h4>
