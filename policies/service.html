                <h2>Terms of Service - Closure Next:</h2>
                  <h3>Last Update: 02/21/2025</h3>
                  <h3>1. Introduction:</h3>
                    <p>By accessing or using any part of the Closure Next project (which includes the Closure Next library, the Closure Next website, the Closure Next bot, and associated social media accounts), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. These terms apply to all users and contributors, and cover aspects such as usage, contribution guidelines, and the permissions granted to the Closure Next Team and contributors.</p>
                  <h3>2. Bot Functionality:</h3>
                    <p>The Closure Next bot does not collect any personal data. It interacts solely with public data from the Closure Next GitHub repository. Whenever a change (such as a commit or pull request) is made, the Closure Next repository makes a cURL request to the bot’s repository, which retrieves the commit message or pull request information and publishes it to the official Closure Next Telegram channel. The bot only works within the official Closure Next Telegram channel and will not post to any other channels. The bot utilizes the GitHub API and the Telegram API, and it is open-source.</p>
                  <h3>3. Use of Social Media:</h3>
                    <p>Closure Next maintains official accounts on several social media platforms, including X/Twitter, Bluesky, and Fosstodon (Mastodon). These platforms are used for announcements, updates, and discussions regarding the Closure Next library. Users are welcome to message the official Closure Next X/Twitter account if they have any issues or inquiries.</p>
                  <h3>4. Security Vulnerabilities:</h3>
                    <p>For any security vulnerabilities, users must not report them through GitHub Discussions or GitHub Issues, but instead should send an email directly to: <a href="mailto:security@milesonerd.8shield.net">security@milesonerd.8shield.net</a></p>
                  <h3>5. Licensing and Copyright:</h3>
                    <p>The Closure Next library is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, the bot code is licensed under the MIT license, and the Closure Next website is licensed under the BSD-3 license.</p>
                    <p>The rights to the Closure Next project, including the code, the library, and associated materials, belong to Enzo Fuke (the creator) and the Closure Next Team, as outlined in the AUTHORS.md file of the repository. Contributions to the project must include the contributor’s name and email, which will be added to this file. As the creator of the Closure Next project and a member of the Closure Next Team, Enzo Fuke retains the final say on decisions regarding the project.</p>
                  <h3>6. Contributing to the Project:</h3>
                    <p>If you wish to contribute code to the Closure Next project, you may do so by forking the repository, creating a new branch (e.g., git checkout -b my-feature), making your changes, testing them locally, and then submitting a pull request. Please ensure that all contributions are in line with the project's guidelines.</p>
                    <p>For reporting bugs, issues can be opened in GitHub Issues, and suggestions for improvements should be made through GitHub Discussions. For security-related issues or vulnerabilities, please report them directly via email to: <a href="mailto:security@milesonerd.8shield.net">security@milesonerd.8shield.net</a></p>
                  <h3>7. Use of Closure Next Name in External Platforms:</h3>
                    <p>When publishing Closure Next on external platforms such as Product Hunt, you must request permission to use the Closure Next name. This must be done via a pull request, and Enzo Fuke will review and approve or deny the request. The Closure Next name cannot be used without prior approval.</p>
		    <p>For more information on brand usage, visit the <a href="/policies/brand">Brand Guidelines.</a></p>
                  <h3>8. User Conduct and Responsibility:</h3>
                    <p>Users are expected to interact respectfully with the Closure Next community across all platforms, including GitHub, social media, and the Telegram channel. Any misuse or abuse of the platform may result in removal from the community or being blocked from official channels.</p>
                  <h3>9. Changes to Terms of Service:</h3>
                    <p>Closure Next reserves the right to modify or update these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be communicated via the official Closure Next channels, and continued use of the project will indicate acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
                  <h3>10. Contact Information:</h3>
